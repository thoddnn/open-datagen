Any amendment to this Regulation 
pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article, or 
relevant future delegated or implementing 
acts, which concern sectoral legislation 
listed in Annex II Ssection B, shall take 
into account the regulatory specificities of 
each sector, and existing governance, 
conformity assessment and enforcement 
mechanisms and authorities established 
therein. Biases can for 
example be inherent in underlying 
datasets, especially when historical data is 
being used, introduced by the developers 
of the algorithms, or generated when the 
systems are implemented in real world 
settings. In the case of ‘real-
time’ systems, the capturing of the 
biometric data, the comparison and the 
identification occur all instantaneously, 
near-instantaneously or in any event 
without a significant delay. In such a case, it shall also 
immediately inform the national 
supervisory authority of the Member State 
in which it is established, as well as, 
where applicable, the relevant notified 
body, about the termination of the 
mandate and the reasons thereof. The provider shall draw up a written 
machine readable, physical or electronic 
EU declaration of conformity for each 
high-risk AI system and keep it at the 
disposal of the national supervisory 
authority and the national competent 
authorities for 10 years after the AI high-
risk system has been placed on the market 
or put into service. Combined with their 
complexity and unexpected impact, the 
downstream AI provider’s lack of control 
over the foundation model’s development 
and the consequent power imbalance and 
in order to ensure a fair sharing of 
responsibilities along the AI value chain, 
such models should be subject to 
proportionate and more specific 
requirements and obligations under this 
Regulation, namely foundation models 
should assess and mitigate possible risks 
and harms through appropriate design, 
testing and analysis, should implement 
data governance measures, including 
assessment of biases, and should comply 
with technical design requirements to 
ensure appropriate levels of performance, 
predictability, interpretability, 
corrigibility, safety and cybersecurity and 
should comply with environmental 
standards. Furthermore, 
the exercise of important procedural 
fundamental rights, such as the right to an 
effective remedy and to a fair trial as well 
as the right of defence and the presumption 
of innocence, could be hampered, in 
particular, where such AI systems are not 
sufficiently transparent, explainable and 
documented. The AI 
Office should have legal personality, 
should act in full independence, should be 
responsible for a number of advisory and 
coordination tasks, including issuing 
opinions, recommendations, advice or 
guidance on matters related to the 
implementation of this Regulation and 
should be adequately funded and staffed. Providers shall in any event 
respect the degree of rigour and the level 
of protection required to ensure 
compliance of their AI systems with this 
Regulation. The risk management measures 
referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall 
give due consideration to the effects and 
possible interactions resulting from the 
combined application of the requirements 
set out in this Chapter 2. The 
Joint Research Centre shall be permanent 
member, without voting rights. This requires

Any amendment to this Regulation 
pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article, or 
relevant future delegated or implementing 
acts, which concern sectoral legislation 
listed in Annex II Ssection B, shall take 
into account the regulatory specificities of 
each sector, and existing governance, 
conformity assessment and enforcement 
mechanisms and authorities established 
therein. Biases can for 
example be inherent in underlying 
datasets, especially when historical data is 
being used, introduced by the developers 
of the algorithms, or generated when the 
systems are implemented in real world 
settings. In the case of ‘real-
time’ systems, the capturing of the 
biometric data, the comparison and the 
identification occur all instantaneously, 
near-instantaneously or in any event 
without a significant delay. In such a case, it shall also 
immediately inform the national 
supervisory authority of the Member State 
in which it is established, as well as, 
where applicable, the relevant notified 
body, about the termination of the 
mandate and the reasons thereof. The provider shall draw up a written 
machine readable, physical or electronic 
EU declaration of conformity for each 
high-risk AI system and keep it at the 
disposal of the national supervisory 
authority and the national competent 
authorities for 10 years after the AI high-
risk system has been placed on the market 
or put into service. Combined with their 
complexity and unexpected impact, the 
downstream AI provider’s lack of control 
over the foundation model’s development 
and the consequent power imbalance and 
in order to ensure a fair sharing of 
responsibilities along the AI value chain, 
such models should be subject to 
proportionate and more specific 
requirements and obligations under this 
Regulation, namely foundation models 
should assess and mitigate possible risks 
and harms through appropriate design, 
testing and analysis, should implement 
data governance measures, including 
assessment of biases, and should comply 
with technical design requirements to 
ensure appropriate levels of performance, 
predictability, interpretability, 
corrigibility, safety and cybersecurity and 
should comply with environmental 
standards. Furthermore, 
the exercise of important procedural 
fundamental rights, such as the right to an 
effective remedy and to a fair trial as well 
as the right of defence and the presumption 
of innocence, could be hampered, in 
particular, where such AI systems are not 
sufficiently transparent, explainable and 
documented. The AI 
Office should have legal personality, 
should act in full independence, should be 
responsible for a number of advisory and 
coordination tasks, including issuing 
opinions, recommendations, advice or 
guidance on matters related to the 
implementation of this Regulation and 
should be adequately funded and staffed. Providers shall in any event 
respect the degree of rigour and the level 
of protection required to ensure 
compliance of their AI systems with this

'''The obligations provided for with regard to monitoring the functioning of AI systems, as mentioned in the EU AI Act regulation paper, include ensuring that deployers use high-risk AI systems in accordance with the instructions of use and implementing appropriate technical and organizational arrangements to protect intellectual property rights or trade secrets.'''","Any amendment to this Regulation 
pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article, or 
relevant future delegated or implementing 
acts, which concern sectoral legislation 
listed in Annex II Ssection B, shall take 
into account the regulatory specificities of 
each sector, and existing governance, 
conformity assessment and enforcement 
mechanisms and authorities established 
therein. Biases can for 
example be inherent in underlying 
datasets, especially when historical data is 
being used, introduced by the developers 
of the algorithms, or generated when the 
systems are implemented in real world 
settings. In the case of ‘real-
time’ systems, the capturing of the 
biometric data, the comparison and the 
identification occur all instantaneously, 
near-instantaneously or in any event 
without a significant delay. In such a case, it shall also 
immediately inform the national 
supervisory authority of the Member State 
in which it is established, as well as, 
where applicable, the relevant notified 
body, about the termination of the 
mandate and the reasons thereof. The provider shall draw up a written 
machine readable, physical or electronic 
EU declaration of conformity for each 
high-risk AI system and keep it at the 
disposal of the national supervisory 
authority and the national competent 
authorities for 10 years after the AI high-
risk system has been placed on the market 
or put into service. Combined with their 
complexity and unexpected impact, the 
downstream AI provider’s lack of control 
over the foundation model’s development 
and the consequent power imbalance and 
in order to ensure a fair sharing of 
responsibilities along the AI value chain, 
such models should be subject to 
proportionate and more specific 
requirements and obligations under this 
Regulation, namely foundation models 
should assess and mitigate possible risks 
and harms through appropriate design, 
testing and analysis, should implement 
data governance measures, including 
assessment of biases, and should comply 
with technical design requirements to 
ensure appropriate levels of performance, 
predictability, interpretability, 
corrigibility, safety and cybersecurity and 
should comply with environmental 
standards. Furthermore, 
the exercise of important procedural 
fundamental rights, such as the right to an 
effective remedy and to a fair trial as well 
as the right of defence and the presumption 
of innocence, could be hampered, in 
particular, where such AI systems are not 
sufficiently transparent, explainable and 
documented. The AI 
Office should have legal personality, 
should act in full independence, should be 
responsible for a number of advisory and 
coordination tasks, including issuing 
opinions, recommendations, advice or 
guidance on matters related to the 
implementation of this Regulation and 
should be adequately funded and staffed. Providers shall in any event 
respect the degree of rigour and the level 
of protection required to ensure 
compliance of their AI systems with this 
Regulation. The risk management measures 
referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall 
give due consideration to the effects and 
possible interactions resulting from the 
combined application of the requirements 
set out in this Chapter 2. The 
Joint Research Centre shall be permanent 
member, without voting rights. This requires 
keeping records and the availability of a 
technical documentation, containing 
information which is necessary to assess 
the compliance of the AI system with the 
relevant requirements. where possible, the deployer. Amendment 231

Regulation, namely foundation models
